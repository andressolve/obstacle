create image: Subject:
A powerful, iconic finale image. A young boy stands at the mountain summit, arms slightly raised in quiet triumph, bathed in golden sunrise light from behind. 

The mountain itself tells his story — its rocky face is subtly composed of the obstacles he overcame: jagged boulders from a rockslide form the lower slopes, swirling storm clouds are frozen into the mid-section rock texture, and a deep crevasse scar runs across the upper face. These elements are integrated naturally into the mountain's geology, visible but not cartoonish.

The boy is silhouetted against the golden sky, but key details catch the light: his wind-swept hair, the edge of his gray jacket, the orange climbing harness at his waist. His posture is peaceful, victorious, breathing in the moment.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture
Color palette: deep sunrise gold, warm orange, slate gray rock, snow white highlights, deep purple shadows
Effects: Dramatic golden hour backlighting, god rays breaking through clouds, atmospheric depth, wind motion in hair and jacket

CHARACTER — KAI (silhouetted but recognizable):
- 12-year-old boy, lean athletic build
- Short dark brown hair, wind-swept
- Stone gray technical jacket with hood down
- Orange climbing harness visible at waist
- Arms slightly raised, palms open, head tilted back slightly
- Pose: quiet triumph, gratitude, peace

Composition:
- Kai positioned in lower third, centered
- Mountain peak and golden sky fill upper two-thirds
- Text positioned in upper portion against golden sky
- Clouds below the summit to emphasize height

Text (centered in upper third, bold, warm white with subtle gold glow): 
"THE OBSTACLE IS THE WAY"

General Instruction:
This is an iconic, poster-worthy image meant for animation. Keep composition clean and layered for parallax effects. The golden backlighting should feel warm and triumphant. The mountain's obstacle-textures should be subtle enough to reward a second look but not distract from the emotional impact. Text must be crisp, legible, and integrated into the composition.

Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (landscape, optimized for video)

## Animation Notes

This image is designed with animation in mind:

**Parallax layers (front to back):**
1. Kai (foreground) — subtle breathing motion, hair/jacket flutter
2. Summit rocks (mid-ground) — static or very slow drift
3. Mountain face with obstacle textures (mid-background) — static
4. Golden sky and god rays (background) — slow ray movement, subtle pulse
5. Clouds below summit (background) — slow drift

**Suggested motions:**
- God rays: gentle shimmer/pulse (2-3 second cycle)
- Clouds: slow horizontal drift
- Kai's hair/jacket: gentle wind flutter
- Optional: slow camera push-in toward Kai

**Text treatment:**
- Fade in after 1-2 seconds
- Or: already present, subtle warm glow pulse

## Alternate Aspect Ratios

For different platforms, adjust the final line:

- **YouTube/Video:** `Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (landscape)`
- **Instagram Reels/TikTok:** `Aspect Ratio: 9:16 (vertical)` — reposition Kai lower, text in upper third
- **Square (Instagram post):** `Aspect Ratio: 1:1` — tighter crop on Kai and summit
