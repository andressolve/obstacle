Panel 4 (Bottom quarter, Wide Horizontal):
Visual: Wide shot showing the full scale of the obstacle. Kai is small in the 
lower left, sitting against a boulder. The rockslide fills most of the frame — 
massive, immovable, impassive. Harsh sunlight beats down. The mountain continues 
upward beyond the blockage, tantalizingly visible but unreachable.
Text (Caption Box): "The mountain did not move."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. Thought bubble cloud style with italics. 
The atmosphere should feel oppressive, frustrating, and humbling.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 5 — A DIFFERENT WAY

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 4 panels showing Kai's shift in 
thinking and discovery of an alternative path. The setting transitions from 
the blocked canyon to exploring the canyon walls, late afternoon light.

expression is changing — eyes looking sideways, noticing something. Afternoon 
light catches his face from a new angle. A spark of curiosity replacing despair.
Text (Caption Box): "He sat with the obstacle. And then he saw it differently."

Panel 2 (Second quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Kai's point-of-view shot looking at the canyon wall beside the rockslide. 
A narrow ledge system is visible along the cliff face — not a path exactly, but 
a possible route. Handholds and footholds visible in the rock. It bypasses the 
blockage entirely, traversing around it.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Third quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Medium shot of Kai standing now, studying the canyon wall with new eyes. 
He's tracing the potential route with his gaze, one hand touching the rock surface, 
testing it. His posture has shifted from defeated to engaged, analytical.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "Not through. Around."

Panel 4 (Bottom quarter, Wide Horizontal):
Visual: Wider shot showing Kai beginning to climb the canyon wall on the ledge 
system. He's moved past the rubble pile, traversing horizontally along the cliff 
face. Below him, the rockslide is visible — he's going around it. Warm afternoon 
light suggests hope. The route is difficult but possible.
Text (Caption Box): "The obstacle had shown him a new way."
Text (Caption Box): "A harder way. But his way."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. The atmosphere should shift from 
defeated to hopeful, from stuck to moving. Lighting should support this 
emotional transition — warmer, more golden as the page progresses.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3
```

## PAGE 6 — THE CLIMB CONTINUES

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels showing Kai successfully 
navigating past the first obstacle and continuing his ascent with new wisdom. 
The setting is above the canyon, approaching the middle slopes of Cloud Peak, 
golden hour light.

canyon section. He's cleared the obstacle. Behind and below him, we can see 
the canyon with the rockslide — he's now above it. Golden hour light catches 
him from the side. His expression shows quiet satisfaction, not celebration — 
earned progress.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 2 (Middle third, Horizontal):
Visual: Medium shot of Kai standing on the new terrain above the canyon, 
looking up at the mountain that still rises above him. Cloud Peak's upper 
slopes are visible — still far to go. Storm clouds are subtly visible gathering 
in the distance (foreshadowing). But for now, the light is golden and the 
moment is his.
Text (Caption Box): "The first obstacle was behind him."
Text (Caption Box): "The mountain had more lessons to teach."

Panel 3 (Bottom third, Horizontal — Looking ahead):
Visual: Over-the-shoulder shot from behind Kai, looking up at the path ahead. 
The middle slopes of Cloud Peak stretch upward. In the distance, an exposed 
ridge is visible with dark clouds beginning to gather around it (the next 
obstacle — the storm). Kai is small against the vast mountain, but he's moving 
forward. His silhouette shows determination.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "What stands in the way becomes the way."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. Thought bubble with Marcus Aurelius quote 
should feel like a realization, not a lecture. The atmosphere should feel 
earned, contemplative, but aware that more challenges await. Golden light 
suggests temporary triumph before the next test.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

upward on an open rocky slope — no shelter, no trees, fully exposed terrain. 
Behind him, massive storm clouds are building, dark and ominous. The last rays 
of golden sunlight illuminate Kai while the sky behind grows dark. Wind is 
visibly moving his hair and jacket.
Text (Caption Box): "The mountain's second lesson announced itself on the wind."

Panel 2 (Middle third, Horizontal):
Visual: Medium shot of Kai paused on the slope, looking back over his shoulder 
at the approaching storm. His expression shows concern but not panic — assessing 
the threat. The storm clouds are closer now, textured and threatening. First 
wisps of mist are reaching toward him.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "Too exposed. Can't outrun it."

Panel 3 (Bottom third, Horizontal):
Visual: Close-up of Kai's face as the first drops of rain hit. His eyes are 
scanning the terrain ahead, searching. Wind whips his hair. The lighting has 
shifted — golden light gone, replaced by the gray-purple of storm light. 
Determination in his expression despite the threat.
Text (Speech Bubble - Kai): "There has to be shelter somewhere."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. The atmosphere should feel urgent, 
threatening, transitional — the calm before the real storm hits.

Visual: Close-up of Kai's hands gripping a rock outcrop, knuckles white. 
Rain pours over his hands. The small scar on his right knuckle visible. 
Below his hands, we can see the slope falling away — the danger of a fall.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "Can't go forward. Can't go back."

Panel 4 (Bottom quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Kai pressed against a rock face, finding minimal shelter in a shallow 
depression in the cliff. He's huddled, arms wrapped around himself, waiting. 
Rain still falls but he's slightly protected. His expression shows patience 
learned from the first obstacle — not fighting, waiting.
Text (Caption Box): "So he stopped fighting. And waited."

General Instruction:
Render sound effect in jagged, electric lettering. Caption boxes should feel 
battered but readable. The atmosphere should be overwhelming, dangerous, humbling.

Visual: Medium shot of Kai standing on the ridge, looking toward the summit. 
Clouds still swirl but are breaking apart. The peak is visible through gaps — 
closer now, more real. His wet clothes cling to him but his posture is 
renewed, energized. Soft light catches his face.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "The obstacle was time. The way through was patience."
Text (Caption Box): "The second lesson learned."

General Instruction:

Visual: Kai pauses, looking ahead. In front of him, a dark crevasse cuts 
across the route — a deep crack in the ice and rock, blocking the direct 
path to the summit. The third obstacle revealed. His expression shows 
recognition — not surprise, not despair. He's learned.
Text (Speech Bubble - Kai, quiet): "And there you are."
Text (Caption Box): "The third obstacle. The final lesson."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. The atmosphere should feel high, cold,

Panel 2 (Middle third, Horizontal):
Visual: Kai pulling himself up onto the far side of the crevasse. His hands 
grip the rock, muscles straining as he hauls himself over the edge. The rope

illuminates him. This is the moment.

## PAGE 14 — REFLECTION

```

A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels showing Kai reflecting 
on the journey from the summit. The philosophical conclusion.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture
Color palette: warm gold, sky blue, snow white, slate gray, earth brown
Effects: Beautiful golden hour summit light, vast panoramic views, contemplative atmosphere

CHARACTER KAI (must appear identical in all panels):

- Orange climbing harness, rope coiled, weathered canvas backpack

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top third, Horizontal):
Visual: Kai sitting on the summit, looking out at the view. He's removed 
his backpack, it sits beside him. His posture is relaxed, contemplative. 
The world spreads out below — clouds, distant peaks, the forest far below 
where he started. Golden light.
Text (Caption Box): "From the summit, he could see the whole path."

Panel 2 (Middle third, Wide Horizontal):
Visual: Kai's point-of-view looking down at the mountain he climbed. We can 
see the route — the canyon with the rockslide (now small below), the storm 
ridge (clouds still dissipating around it), the crevasse (a thin dark line 
in the snow). The three obstacles visible as parts of the whole journey.
Text (Caption Box): "The rockslide that taught him to find another way."
Text (Caption Box): "The storm that taught him patience."
Text (Caption Box): "The crevasse that taught him to trust his skills."

Panel 3 (Bottom third, Horizontal):
Visual: Close-up of Kai's face in profile, looking at the view with quiet 
wisdom. He's 12, but his eyes hold something older now — experience, 
understanding. The golden light is warm on his features. Peace in his expression.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "The obstacle is the way."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. Thought bubble should feel like 
internalized wisdom, not recitation. The atmosphere should be contemplative, 
peaceful, conclusive.

Text (Caption Box): "And he would remember:"
Text (Final caption, centered, slightly larger): "What stands in the way becomes the way."

## GENERATION NOTES

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Generate Page 0 (Character Reference Sheet) first
2. Review: Does Kai look right? All details visible? Regenerate if needed.
3. Save character sheet image
4. Generate Cover with character sheet uploaded as reference
5. Generate Pages 1-6 sequentially, always uploading character sheet as reference
6. Add to each prompt: "featuring the same character shown in the reference image"

**If character drift occurs:**
- Add to prompt: "featuring the same character from the reference image"
- Add: "maintain identical facial structure and proportions"
- Regenerate with previous successful page as reference

**If style drifts:**
- Ensure style block is copied exactly
- Check that palette colors are consistent
- Add: "match the visual style of the reference image exactly"

**Text issues:**
- If text garbles, simplify to fewer words per bubble
- Regenerate with "text must be sharp and clearly legible"
- Consider generating without text and adding in post-production
