## PAGE 3 — THE ROCKSLIDE

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels with dramatic reveal structure. 
The setting is a canyon on Cloud Peak, moments during and after a rockslide. 
Dust-filled air, dramatic lighting.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture
Color palette: slate gray, warm gold, dust brown, deep earth brown, muted blue

- Strong brow, expressive dark eyes, shocked expression
- Short dark brown hair, now dusty
- Stone gray technical jacket, muted blue shirt, earth-tone pants
- Orange climbing harness, coiled rope, weathered canvas backpack
- Small scar on right knuckle

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top third, Wide Horizontal — Dramatic Action):
Visual: Dynamic wide shot capturing the rockslide in motion. Boulders and 
debris cascade down the canyon walls. Dust billows upward in thick clouds. 
Kai is small in the frame, caught mid-motion diving backward, arms raised 
instinctively. Motion blur on falling rocks. Dramatic side-lighting cuts 
through the dust.
Text (Sound Effect, large, jagged): "KRAAAAASH"
Text (Speech Bubble - Kai, small, urgent): "No— wait—"

Panel 2 (Middle third, Full Width — The Aftermath):
Visual: Wide shot moments later. The dust is beginning to settle. A massive 
pile of boulders and debris now completely blocks the canyon path. The 
obstruction is substantial and impassable. Kai stands in the foreground, 
his back to us, frozen, staring at the blocked path. Dust particles float 
in shafts of light. Silence after chaos.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Bottom third, Close-up):
Visual: Close-up of Kai's face, covered in light dust. His expression shows 
shock transitioning to dismay. Eyes wide, processing what just happened.

the wall of rubble.
Text (Caption Box): "The path he knew was gone."

General Instruction:
Render sound effect in bold, jagged comic lettering suggesting impact and chaos. 
Caption box clean and understated. The atmosphere should feel sudden, 
disorienting, then settling into quiet devastation.

## PAGE 4 — STRANDED

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 4 panels showing frustration and 
failed attempts to overcome the rockslide. The setting is the blocked canyon 
on Cloud Peak, harsh midday light.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture
Color palette: slate gray, warm gold, dust brown, deep earth brown, muted blue
Effects: Harsh overhead sun, sharp shadows, dust on everything

CHARACTER KAI (must appear identical in all panels):
- 12-year-old boy, lean athletic build
- Strong brow, expressive dark eyes, frustrated expression
- Short dark brown hair, now dusty and disheveled
- Stone gray technical jacket (dusty), muted blue shirt, earth-tone pants
- Orange climbing harness, coiled rope, weathered canvas backpack
- Small scar on right knuckle, small cut on cheek from rockslide

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Medium shot of Kai attempting to climb the rockslide debris. He's 
partway up the pile of boulders, reaching for a handhold. His expression 
shows determination mixed with strain. Loose rocks visible, unstable footing.
Text (Caption Box): "He tried the direct approach first."

Panel 2 (Second quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Action shot — rocks sliding out from under Kai's feet. He's slipping 
backward, arms pinwheeling for balance. Small rocks cascade down. Dust kicks up.
Text (Sound Effect): "SKFF SKFF"
Text (Speech Bubble - Kai, small): "No, no, no—"

Panel 3 (Third quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Kai sitting at the base of the rubble pile, defeated posture. Knees up, 
arms resting on knees, head slightly bowed. Dust settles around him. The massive 
wall of debris looms above him, emphasizing how insurmountable it is.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "I can't force this."

Panel 4 (Bottom quarter, Wide Horizontal):
Visual: Wide shot showing the full scale of the obstacle. Kai is small in the 
lower left, sitting against a boulder. The rockslide fills most of the frame — 
massive, immovable, impassive. Harsh sunlight beats down. The mountain continues 
upward beyond the blockage, tantalizingly visible but unreachable.
Text (Caption Box): "The mountain did not move."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. Thought bubble cloud style with italics. 
The atmosphere should feel oppressive, frustrating, and humbling.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3

## PAGE 5 — A DIFFERENT WAY

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 4 panels showing Kai's shift in 
thinking and discovery of an alternative path. The setting transitions from 
the blocked canyon to exploring the canyon walls, late afternoon light.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture
Color palette: slate gray, warm gold, snow white, deep earth brown, muted blue
Effects: Warm late afternoon light, longer shadows, subtle hope in lighting

CHARACTER KAI (must appear identical in all panels):
- 12-year-old boy, lean athletic build
- Strong brow, expressive dark eyes, shifting from defeat to curiosity
- Short dark brown hair, still somewhat dusty
- Stone gray technical jacket, muted blue shirt, earth-tone pants
- Orange climbing harness, coiled rope, weathered canvas backpack
- Small scar on right knuckle, healing cut on cheek

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Close-up of Kai's face, still sitting against the boulder. But his 
expression is changing — eyes looking sideways, noticing something. Afternoon 
light catches his face from a new angle. A spark of curiosity replacing despair.
Text (Caption Box): "He sat with the obstacle. And then he saw it differently."

Panel 2 (Second quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Kai's point-of-view shot looking at the canyon wall beside the rockslide. 
A narrow ledge system is visible along the cliff face — not a path exactly, but 
a possible route. Handholds and footholds visible in the rock. It bypasses the 
blockage entirely, traversing around it.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 3 (Third quarter, Horizontal):
Visual: Medium shot of Kai standing now, studying the canyon wall with new eyes. 
He's tracing the potential route with his gaze, one hand touching the rock surface, 
testing it. His posture has shifted from defeated to engaged, analytical.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "Not through. Around."

Panel 4 (Bottom quarter, Wide Horizontal):
Visual: Wider shot showing Kai beginning to climb the canyon wall on the ledge 
system. He's moved past the rubble pile, traversing horizontally along the cliff 
face. Below him, the rockslide is visible — he's going around it. Warm afternoon 
light suggests hope. The route is difficult but possible.
Text (Caption Box): "The obstacle had shown him a new way."
Text (Caption Box): "A harder way. But his way."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. The atmosphere should shift from 
defeated to hopeful, from stuck to moving. Lighting should support this 
emotional transition — warmer, more golden as the page progresses.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3
```

## PAGE 6 — THE CLIMB CONTINUES

```
create image: Subject:
A complete comic book page consisting of 3 panels showing Kai successfully 
navigating past the first obstacle and continuing his ascent with new wisdom. 
The setting is above the canyon, approaching the middle slopes of Cloud Peak, 
golden hour light.

Art Style: Cinematic painterly realism with restrained brush texture
Color palette: slate gray, warm gold, snow white, deep earth brown, muted blue
Effects: Beautiful golden hour lighting, long dramatic shadows, sense of achievement

CHARACTER KAI (must appear identical in all panels):
- 12-year-old boy, lean athletic build
- Strong brow, expressive dark eyes, quiet confidence
- Short dark brown hair, windswept
- Stone gray technical jacket, muted blue shirt, earth-tone pants
- Orange climbing harness, coiled rope, weathered canvas backpack
- Small scar on right knuckle, healing cut on cheek

Panel Breakdown & Visuals:

Panel 1 (Top third, Wide Horizontal — Triumph moment):
Visual: Wide shot from below as Kai pulls himself up onto a ledge above the 
canyon section. He's cleared the obstacle. Behind and below him, we can see 
the canyon with the rockslide — he's now above it. Golden hour light catches 
him from the side. His expression shows quiet satisfaction, not celebration — 
earned progress.
Text: [No Text]

Panel 2 (Middle third, Horizontal):
Visual: Medium shot of Kai standing on the new terrain above the canyon, 
looking up at the mountain that still rises above him. Cloud Peak's upper 
slopes are visible — still far to go. Storm clouds are subtly visible gathering 
in the distance (foreshadowing). But for now, the light is golden and the 
moment is his.
Text (Caption Box): "The first obstacle was behind him."
Text (Caption Box): "The mountain had more lessons to teach."

Panel 3 (Bottom third, Horizontal — Looking ahead):
Visual: Over-the-shoulder shot from behind Kai, looking up at the path ahead. 
The middle slopes of Cloud Peak stretch upward. In the distance, an exposed 
ridge is visible with dark clouds beginning to gather around it (the next 
obstacle — the storm). Kai is small against the vast mountain, but he's moving 
forward. His silhouette shows determination.
Text (Thought Bubble - Kai, italics): "What stands in the way becomes the way."

General Instruction:
Render text in clean caption boxes. Thought bubble with Marcus Aurelius quote 
should feel like a realization, not a lecture. The atmosphere should feel 
earned, contemplative, but aware that more challenges await. Golden light 
suggests temporary triumph before the next test.

Aspect Ratio: Vertical 2:3
